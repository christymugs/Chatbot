# Large Language Model AI Chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation

This project implements a state-of-the-art AI chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. RAG combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches, enabling the chatbot to generate responses based on retrieved information from a large knowledge base.

## Features

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Utilizes a pre-trained language model to generate responses while incorporating information retrieval from a knowledge base.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Easily integrate and update a knowledge base to improve the chatbot's responses.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot in real-time.
- **Scalable**: The architecture is designed to scale efficiently to handle large volumes of user interactions.
- **Modular Design**: Components are modularized for easy maintenance and extensibility.
